## Setup development environment

To setup the development environment for this project, you will need to obtain the _**ZXPSignCmd**_ tool provided by Adobe, which can be found [here](https://labs.adobe.com/downloads/extensionbuilder3.html). Once you have logged in using your existing Adobe user account, download the _**CC Extensions Signing Toolkit**_, which will provide you with the necessary executable.

If you are developing on a ***Mac*** please set all necessary variables in `dev/env.mk`.

On ***Windows*** please fill all necessary variables in `dev\env.cmd`

From now on you may test and sign with the following targets:

---
***Note***
Be sure to run all of the following commands from the top-level directory of this project.
---


### To install the CEP extension for testing without signing:
```
cd dev
make test
```

### To sign the CEP extension
```
cd dev
make sign
```


### To create a certificate for use when signing the CEP extension
```
cd dev
make create_certificate
```

---
***Note***
In the case where the configured CERTIFICATE_FILE does not exist, the create_certificate command will be automatically run as part of the _sign_ target.
---


### To remove the latest signed zxp file
```
cd dev
make clean
```

### Notes on editing the env files (env.mk/env.cmd)

Changes to the env files (env.mk and env.cmd) will typically not be tracked in git. The information contained in these files is specific to a particular development environment, so tracking changes to that data in git is undesirable.

If you need to make changes to these files, you can use the following commands:

```
git update-index --no-skip-worktree dev/env.mk dev/env.cmd
git add dev\env.*
git commit -m "your message"
git update-index --skip-worktree dev/env.mk dev/env.cmd
```

Please be aware that these files contain potentially-sensitive information, such as a certificate password. When making changes to these files and pushing them to a git repository, be sure that you've removed any data that might be considered confidential.
