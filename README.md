# tk-framework-adobe

A framework for Adobe engines


## Development

### How to set up your development environment

- To setup the development environment for this project, you will need to obtain the [**ZXPSignCmd**](https://zxpinstaller.com/) tool provided by Adobe.
- Once you have logged in using your existing Adobe user account, download the **CC Extensions Signing Toolkit**, which will provide you with the necessary executable.
- If you are developing on a **Mac**, please set all necessary variables in `dev/env.mk`.
- If you are developing on **Windows**, please set all necessary variables in `dev\env.cmd`

This is what the env file should look like:
```
TARGET_VERSION=1.1.3 # Make sure this matches the tk-framework-adobe version you will be releasing

TKCORE_VERSION=0.19.19  # This core version is expected to exist in your bundle cache

ZXP_SIGN_TOOL=/path/to/bin/ZXPSignCmd

CERTIFICATE_FILE=/path/to/file/location/cert.p12

CERTIFICATE_PASS=<Make up your own secure password>
CERT_COUNTRY=<Two Character Country Code>
CERT_STATE=<Two Character State or Province Code>
CERT_ORG=Autodesk
CERT_CN=SGTK
```

Follow [this link](https://developer.shotgridsoftware.com/7c9867c0/#bundle-cache)
  to find out where your bundle cache is located.

### To install the CEP extension for testing without signing:

```
cd path/to/tk-adobe-framework
cd dev
make test
```

### To sign the CEP extension

```
cd path/to/tk-adobe-framework
cd dev
make sign
```


### To create a certificate for use when signing the CEP extension

```
cd path/to/tk-adobe-framework
cd dev
make create_certificate
```

**Note:** In the case where the configured `CERTIFICATE_FILE` does not exist, the create_certificate command will be automatically run as part of the _sign_ target.


### To remove the latest signed zxp file

```
cd path/to/tk-adobe-framework
cd dev
make clean
```

### Notes on editing the env files (`env.mk` and `env.cmd`)

Changes to the env files (`env.mk` and `env.cmd`) will typically not be tracked in git. The information contained in these files is specific to a particular development environment, so tracking changes to that data in git is undesirable.

If you need to make changes to these files, you can use the following commands:

```
git update-index --no-skip-worktree dev/env.mk dev/env.cmd
git add dev\env.*
git commit -m "your message"
git update-index --skip-worktree dev/env.mk dev/env.cmd
```

Please be aware that these files contain potentially-sensitive information, such as a certificate password. When making changes to these files and pushing them to a git repository, be sure that you've removed any data that might be considered confidential.
