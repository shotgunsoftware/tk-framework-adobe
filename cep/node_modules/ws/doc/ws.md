## Class: WebSocket.Server

This class represents a WebSocket server. It extends the `EventEmitter`.

### new WebSocket.Server(options[, callback])

- `options` {Object}
  - `host` {String} The hostname where to bind the server.
  - `port` {Number} The port where to bind the server.
  - `backlog` {Number} The maximum length of the queue of pending connections.
  - `server` {http.Server|https.Server} A pre-created Node.js HTTP server.
  - `verifyClient` {Function} A function which can be used to validate incoming
    connections. See description below.
  - `handleProtocols` {Function} A function which can be used to handle the
    WebSocket subprotocols. See description below.
  - `path` {String} Accept only connections matching this path.
  - `noServer` {Boolean} Enable no server mode.
  - `clientTracking` {Boolean} Specifies whether or not to track clients.
  - `perMessageDeflate` {Boolean|Object} Enable/disable permessage-deflate.
  - `maxPayload` {Number} The maximum allowed message size in bytes.
- `callback` {Function}

Create a new server instance. One of `port`, `server` or `noServer` must be
provided or an error is thrown.


If `verifyClient` is not set then the handshake is automatically accepted. If
it is is provided with a single argument then that is:

- `info` {Object}
  - `origin` {String} The value in the Origin header indicated by the client.
  - `req` {http.IncomingMessage} The client HTTP GET request.
  - `secure` {Boolean} `true` if `req.connection.authorized` or
    `req.connection.encrypted` is set.

The return value (Boolean) of the function determines whether or not to accept
the handshake.

if `verifyClient` is provided with two arguments then those are:

- `info` {Object} Same as above.
- `cb` {Function} A callback that must be called by the user upon inspection
  of the `info` fields. Arguments in this callback are:
  - `result` {Boolean} Whether or not to accept the handshake.
  - `code` {Number} When `result` is `false` this field determines the HTTP
    error status code to be sent to the client.
  - `name` {String} When `result` is `false` this field determines the HTTP
    reason phrase.


If `handleProtocols` is not set then the handshake is automatically accepted,
otherwise the function takes two arguments:

- `protocols` {Array} The list of WebSocket subprotocols indicated by the
  client in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header.
- `request` {http.IncomingMessage} The client HTTP GET request.

If returned value is `false` then the handshake is rejected with the HTTP 401
status code, otherwise the returned value sets the value of the
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in the HTTP 101 response.

`perMessageDeflate` can be used to control the behavior of
[permessage-deflate extension][permessage-deflate].
The extension is disabled when `false` (default value). If an object is
provided then that is extension parameters:

- `serverNoContextTakeover` {Boolean} Whether to use context take over or not.
- `clientNoContextTakeover` {Boolean} The value to be requested to clients
  whether to use context take over or not.
- `serverMaxWindowBits` {Number} The value of windowBits.
- `clientMaxWindowBits` {Number} The value of max windowBits to be requested
  to clients.
- `memLevel` {Number} The value of memLevel.
- `threshold` {Number} Payloads smaller than this will not be compressed.
  Defaults to 1024 bytes.

If a property is empty then either an offered configuration or a default value
is used.
When sending a fragmented message the length of the first fragment is compared
to the threshold. This determines if compression is used for the entire message.


`callback` will be added as a listener for the `listening` event when the
HTTP server is created internally and that is when the `port` option is
provided.

### Event: 'connection'

- `socket` {WebSocket}
- `request` {http.IncomingMessage}

Emitted when the handshake is complete. `request` is the http GET request sent
by the client. Useful for parsing authority headers, cookie headers, and other
information.

### Event: 'error'

- `error` {Error}

Emitted when an error occurs on the underlying server.

### Event: 'headers'

- `headers` {Array}
- `request` {http.IncomingMessage}

Emitted before the response headers are written to the socket as part of the
handshake. This allows you to inspect/modify the headers before they are sent.

### Event: 'listening'

Emitted when the underlying server has been bound.

### server.clients

- {Set}

A set that stores all connected clients. Please note that this property is only
added when the `clientTracking` is truthy.

### server.close([callback])

Close the server and terminate all clients, calls callback when done.

### server.handleUpgrade(request, socket, head, callback)

- `request` {http.IncomingMessage} The client HTTP GET request.
- `socket` {net.Socket} The network socket between the server and client.
- `head` {Buffer} The first packet of the upgraded stream.
- `callback` {Function}.

Handle a HTTP upgrade request. When the HTTP server is created internally or
when the HTTP server is passed via the `server` option, this method is called
automatically. When operating in "noServer" mode, this method must be called
manually.

If the upgrade is successfull, the `callback` is called with a `WebSocket`
object as parameter.

### server.shouldHandle(request)

- `request` {http.IncomingMessage} The client HTTP GET request.

See if a given request should be handled by this server.
By default this method validates the pathname of the request, matching it
against the `path` option if provided.
The return value, `true` or `false`, determines whether or not to accept the
handshake.

This method can be overriden when a custom handling logic is required.

## Class: WebSocket

This class represents a WebSocket. It extends the `EventEmitter`.

### Ready state constants

|Constant   | Value | Description                                      |

`perMessageDeflate` default value is `true`. When using an object, parameters
are the same of the server. The only difference is the direction of requests
(e.g. `serverNoContextTakeover` is the value to be requested to the server).

Create a new WebSocket instance.

#### UNIX Domain Sockets

`ws` supports making requests to UNIX domain sockets. To make one, use the
following URL scheme:

```
ws+unix:///absolule/path/to/uds_socket:/pathname?search_params
```

Note that `:` is the separator between the socket path and the URL path. If
the URL path is omitted

```
ws+unix:///absolule/path/to/uds_socket
```

it defaults to `/`.

### Event: 'close'

- `code` {Number}
- `reason` {String}

Emitted when the connection is closed. `code` is a numeric value indicating the
status code explaining why the connection has been closed. `reason` is a
human-readable string explaining why the connection has been closed.

### Event: 'error'

- `error` {Error}

Emitted when an error occurs. Errors from the underlying `net.Socket` are
forwarded here.

### Event: 'headers'

- `headers` {Object}
- `response` {http.IncomingMessage}

Emitted when response headers are received from the server as part of the
handshake.  This allows you to read headers from the server, for example
'set-cookie' headers.

### Event: 'message'

- `data` {String|Buffer|ArrayBuffer|Buffer[]}

Emitted when a message is received from the server.

### Event: 'open'

Emitted when the connection is established.

### Event: 'ping'

- `data` {Buffer}

Emitted when a ping is received from the server.

### Event: 'pong'

- `data` {Buffer}

Emitted when a pong is received from the server.

### Event: 'unexpected-response'

- `request` {http.ClientRequest}
- `response` {http.IncomingMessage}

Emitted when the server response is not the expected one, for example a 401
response. This event gives the ability to read the response in order to extract
useful information. If the server sends an invalid response and there isn't a
listener for this event, an error is emitted.

An event listener to be called when an error occurs. The listener receives
an `Error` instance.

### websocket.onmessage

- {Function}

An event listener to be called when a message is received from the server. The
